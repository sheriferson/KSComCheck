# KSComCheck

![](kscc.png)

[KSComCheck][] is a utility that will notify you of the latest comments posted on Kickstarter projects that you want to follow.

[KSComCheck]: newurlsoon

KSComCheck relies on [terminal-notifier][] for notifications, and so it only works on OS X. It will check against the last comment it saw, and notify you if the newest comment it just fetched is different.

## Installation and usage

To install `terminal-notifier`:

``` bash
$ brew install terminal-notifier
```

Until I find a better way of handling dependencies so you don't have to, the script also needs the following python modules

- [ BeautifulSoup4 ](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- [ requests ](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

``` bash
$ pip install BeautifulSoup4 requests
```

Finally, tell KSComCheck which projects you want to be notified about by listing them (giving them a one-word name) along with the links to their comments pages in `projects.conf`:

```
[projects]
courg = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reduxwatch/redux-courg-hybrid-watches-with-missions-to-tackle/comments
ember = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/842978788/ember-equipment-modular-urban-pack/comments
```

Now give it a test run:
``` bash
$ python KSComCheck.py
```

### Run on a schedule

KSComCheck works best when run on a schedule. You can use whatever scheduling system you want to use. I use and recommend [LaunchControl][9034-0001], a [launchd](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/launchd.8.html) GUI app.

### Known issues

KSComCheck could hang if run within [tmux][5946-0001]. This is related to how [terminal-notifier][] works. See issue [#115](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/115), and especiallly [this comment](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/115#issuecomment-104214742) on a possible fix involving [`reattach-to-user-namespace`][5946-0002].

## Background

Some Kickstarter projects have very active comments pages.

These comments aren't useless; they will often have very valuable information that is revealed or decided by the project creators during the funding phase, or valuable information shared by other backers, and that information is sometimes not communicated successfully to people not actively following the comments sections.

There is no way for you to ask Kickstarter to notify you of comments posted to the project. Kickstarter also -- unfortunately -- has no public API, so I have to resort to web scraping (If anyone from KS is reading, I hope you don't mind.)

## Personal note

I would appreciate any and all constructive criticism about how to make the code or project better.
If you see something in the code or structure that make you think _"wtf?"_ I want to hear about it!
Please take the time to tell me.
